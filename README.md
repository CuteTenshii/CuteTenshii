I'm Yuuto, a 17 yo student from France 🇫🇷.

### What I mainly use...

I mainly use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [React ⚛️](https://react.dev/) (also [Next.js 🔼](https://nextjs.org/) sometimes!), [Tailwind 🌊](https://tailwindcss.com/).

As for my OS: I dual-boot [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (DE: [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)) & [Windows 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11). I also have an hackintosh laptop running [macOS Monterey](https://www.apple.com/by/macos/monterey/).
