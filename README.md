<div align="center"><b>Hi!!</b> Welcome to my profile.</div>
<br>

I don't know what to write soo, I'll just present myself. I'm Yuuto, a french 16 yo guy. I love programming things, but some of these are things are most of the time useless (lol).

Actually I made some useful projects that I published on my GitHub account:

* **Deezer Discord RPC**: A Deezer RPC for showing the music you're listening to on your Discord profile. That's very much like the Spotify integration, but for Deezer.
* **Yuuto's Stealer**: Actually that's a program that steal your data ^^ like your passwords, cookies and others things (why do i have to say this publicly, fuck)
* **Deezer Tweaker**: A tool for modding the Deezer desktop client. Although it's currently in development, I think it can work properly?

Anyway apart from presenting myself, I don't know what to write else honestly.
