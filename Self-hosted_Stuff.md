# Self-hosted Stuff

Sometimes I self-host software on my VPS. Here's a complete list of all the software I self-host.

[VPS Specs](VPS_Specs.md)

## [Vaultwarden](https://vw.tenshii.moe)

[Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) is a Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust.

## [Plausible](https://analytics.yuuto.dev)

[Plausible](https://plausible.io/) is a privacy-friendly analytics tool. It's fully compliant with the GDPR, the CCPA and the PECR. Also, it has a much better UI than Google Analytics.

[Tenshii.moe analytics](https://analytics.tenshii.moe/tenshii.moe/) (yes with Plausible you can make a website analytics public)

## Nginx Proxy Manager

[Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com) is a project that aims to manage Nginx directly from a web UI. This is very handsome because I don't have to edit Nginx configurations (and probably break everything ðŸ¥²)
